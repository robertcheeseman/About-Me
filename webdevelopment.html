                        <p>My first exposure to web development was in an 8th grade html class and it's been in and out of my life ever since.  I've always been the person in every band I've been in who was designated the 'figure it out' guy when it came to an online presence.  Through many years of trial and error I've picked up a basic level understanding of html and am excited to expand upon that from here!  I hope that through the Coding Temple bootcamp I can gain a better understanding of full stack development with the end goal being to change careers into the tech industry as a web-developer.</p>
