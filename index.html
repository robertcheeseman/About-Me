                        <p>I live in Denver, Colorado with my wife Becca and our pup Marley. We moved here in 2018 from Boston, Ma but we're both originally from Virginia and Tennessee, respectively.  We both love to snowboard, hike, travel, and generally enjoy being outdoors and adventuring with our pup whenever we can.  We also spend a lot of time going to shows/concerts here in town and occasionally travel to attend festivals and bigger shows.</p>

                        <p>One of the most important activities in my life has been playing music.  I started playing guitar early on in high school and there basically hasn't been a time where I haven't actively been in a band since then.  I've toured the USA countless times and have played at least one show in all of the 48 continental states over the years and have also played shows in 25 other countries, mostly in Europe.</p>

                        <p>We fostered Marley in the fall of 2019 from a fantastic animal rescue here in Denver called <a href="https://maxfund.org/" target="_blank">Max Fund</a> and after a few short months it became very apparent that we were going to foster fail so she's been with us ever since.  Her favorite activities include napping, snacking, getting treats from our mail-lady, and constantly trying to get us to shower her with love and affection.</p>
